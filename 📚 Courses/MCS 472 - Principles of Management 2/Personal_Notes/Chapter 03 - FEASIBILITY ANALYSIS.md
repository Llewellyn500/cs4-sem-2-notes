# **FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS**

## **What Is Feasibility Analysis?**

- **Definition:** A _preliminary_ evaluation to determine if a business idea is viable—i.e., worth investing time and resources.
    
- **Purpose:** To “screen out” unpromising concepts early, before significant capital is committed.

---

## **When & How to Conduct It**

- **Timing:** As soon as you have a clear business concept—_before_ product development or full business-plan writing.
    
- **Components:** A thorough feasibility analysis comprises four distinct parts (covered below).

---

## **The Four Forms of Feasibility Analysis**

1. **Product/Service Feasibility**
    
2. **Industry/Target-Market Feasibility**
    
3. **Organizational Feasibility**
    
4. **Financial Feasibility**
    

An “Outline for a Comprehensive Feasibility Analysis” typically lays out these sections in a single template, integrating their findings into a cohesive screening tool.

## **Product/Service Feasibility**

### Purpose

Assess the _overall appeal_ of what you plan to offer—ensuring it solves a need, taps a trend, or fills a market gap.

### Two Core Issues

1. **Desirability**
    
    - _Does it make sense?_ Will customers get excited?
        
    - _Environmental fit:_ Leverages trends or solves pressing problems.
        
    - _Timing:_ Is now the right moment to launch?
        
    - _Fatal-flaw check:_ Any design or concept deal-breakers?
        
    - **Concept testing:** Develop a one-page concept statement and solicit feedback to gauge viability and identify tweaks.
        
2. **Demand**
    
    - **Step 1:** _Face-to-face interviews_ with potential customers—ask open questions, refine the idea, or even abandon it if reception is poor.
        
    - **Step 2:** _Online tools_ (e.g., Google AdWords ads + landing pages) to measure click-throughs and email sign-ups as proxies for real interest.
        
    - **Additional resources:** Foundersuite, Quirky for idea feedback; CrowdPicker, Google Trends for market signals; SurveyMonkey, Google Consumer Surveys for polling; Q&A sites (Quora, StackOverflow) for user pain points.

## **Industry & Target-Market Feasibility**

### Purpose

Evaluate both the _industry’s_ overall appeal and the specific _market segment_ you intend to serve.

### Two Core Issues

1. **Industry Attractiveness**
    
    - _Life-cycle stage:_ Young/early industries tend to offer more upside.
        
    - _Structure:_ Fragmented markets (many small players) are easier to enter than concentrated ones.
        
    - _Growth & margins:_ Look for expanding markets with high operating margins.
        
    - _Essential products:_ “Must-have” offerings are less vulnerable to downturns.
        
    - _Raw materials:_ Avoid industries overly dependent on historically low-priced inputs.
        
2. **Target-Market Attractiveness**
    
    - _Segment size:_ Big enough to justify entry, small enough to deter major incumbents.
        
    - _Growth rate:_ Prefer growing segments to recoup marketing and development costs.
        
    - _Profitability:_ Ensure margins will support sustainable operations.
        
    - _Company fit:_ Assess your competitive advantages versus rivals and whether you have the right concept to compete.

## **Organizational Feasibility**

### Purpose

Determine if your team and non-financial resources can successfully launch and support the venture.

### Two Core Issues

1. **Management Prowess**
    
    - _Passion:_ Does the founder(s) truly believe in the idea?
        
    - _Market expertise:_ Does the team deeply understand the target market?
        
2. **Resource Sufficiency**
    
    - List the top 6–12 non-financial resources critical to success.
        
    - Evaluate whether you can secure things like:
        
        - Affordable office, lab, or production space
            
        - Contract manufacturers or service providers
            
        - Key hires (management & support staff)
            
        - Intellectual property protection
            
        - Strategic partnerships

---

## **Financial Feasibility**

### Purpose

A _preliminary_ financial check to verify the venture’s realistic funding needs and potential returns.

### Three Core Issues

1. **Total Start-Up Cash Needed**
    
    - Build a budget listing _all_ capital expenditures and operating expenses required to generate the first GHC 1 in revenue.
        
2. **Financial Performance of Similar Businesses**
    
    - Use industry reports (free or paid) or observational research (e.g., foot traffic & average spend) to benchmark expected sales and margins.
        
3. **Overall Financial Attractiveness**
    
    - Look for signs of a promising investment:
        
        - Steady, rapid sales growth over the first 5–7 years in a clear niche
            
        - High recurring-revenue streams
            
        - Predictable income and expenses
            
        - Ability to self-finance growth
            
        - Viable exit strategies for early investors

## **Feasibility-Analysis Template**

- **What it is:** A structured form that brings together all four analyses into one document.
    
- **When to use:**
    
    - _Early idea screening_—to systematically compare multiple concepts.
        
    - _Investor pitches_—to demonstrate rigorous vetting.
        
    - _Internal decision-making_—to align teams around data-driven go/no-go calls.
