## Key Points
- we are to understand threat, processes and scheduling, interrupts.
- there are 3 main resources a computer has; CPU, memory, I/O device.
- operating system is the interface between the hardware and the system
- every interrupt has its **routine**. They don't interrupt each other
- interrupts affect the normal flow of the computer causing actions to happen. (I.e. OS is interrupt driven)
- DMA - Direct memory access

## Questions
- How does a computer be a user?

## Summary
-  Operating system doesn't have a single definition but its in between the hardware and the system to make it easier for users to use the computer.
