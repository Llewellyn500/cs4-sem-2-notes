# **THE STRATEGIC ROLE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS**

## **Introduction**

- **Beyond Support:** Information systems (IS) aren’t just tools for efficient operations, collaboration, or decision making—they’re strategic assets.
    
- **Organizational Renewal:** IS investments empower firms to reengineer processes, reinvent products/services, and reshape competitive networks.
    
- **Survival & Success:** In today’s fast-changing environment, leveraging IS strategically is key to adapting and thriving.

## **What Are Strategic Information Systems?**

- **Definition:** Systems that alter an organization’s goals, operations, products/services, or external relationships to secure competitive advantage.
    
- **Depth of Impact:** Unlike ordinary strategic-level systems (which aid long-term managerial choices), these can transform the very business of the firm.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - **State Street Bank:** Shifted from traditional banking to electronic record-keeping and pension-fund services.
        
    - **Citibank’s ATMs & Debit Cards (1977):** Revolutionized retail banking and helped Citibank become the largest U.S. bank at one point.

## **Models for Identifying Strategic Opportunities**

### A. Porter’s Competitive Forces Model

Firms must develop IS-enabled strategies to counter these five forces:

1. **Rivalry among existing competitors**
    
2. **Threat of new entrants**
    
3. **Threat of substitutes**
    
4. **Bargaining power of customers**
    
5. **Bargaining power of suppliers**
    

#### Five Basic Competitive Strategies

1. **Cost Leadership**
    
    - Use IS (e.g., inventory-replenishment systems) to lower internal costs and offer lower prices.
        
2. **Differentiation**
    
    - Leverage data mining and analytics to tailor products/services and marketing.
        
3. **Innovation**
    
    - Develop unique IT-enabled offerings or radically new processes that reshape industries.
        
4. **Alliance**
    
    - Form digital linkages (mergers, joint ventures, “virtual companies”) to pool resources—e.g., Baxter Healthcare’s stockless inventory binds customers via supplier-managed stock.
        
5. **Growth**
    
    - Expand capacity, enter new markets, diversify offerings, or integrate vertically using IT.
        

### B. Porter’s Value Chain Model

- **Primary Activities:** Inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, sales & marketing, service.
    
- **Support Activities:** Infrastructure, HR, technology development, procurement.
    
- **Strategic Leverage Points:** Identify where IT can add greatest value—e.g., Wal-Mart’s supplier logistics, Gillette’s CAD for product design, ERP systems to integrate cross-functional processes.

## **Using IT for Competitive Advantage**

### Building a Customer-Focused Business

- **Customer Value:** Prioritize quality and responsiveness over price—track preferences, anticipate needs, tailor services.
    
- **Platforms:** CRM systems plus Internet/Intranet/Extranet portals create continuous, cross-functional customer interaction.
    
- **Outcome:** Stronger customer loyalty, community building among customers/partners/employees.

### Reengineering Business Processes (BPR)

- **Definition:** Radical redesign of processes to achieve breakthroughs in cost, quality, speed, and service.
    
- **Role of IT:** ERP and Internet technologies enable automation, integration, and the formation of self-directed cross-functional teams.
    
- **Risks & Rewards:** High potential payback but also high disruption and failure risk if not managed holistically.

### Becoming an Agile Company

- **Agility:** The ability to prosper in volatile, fragmented markets with mass-customized, customer-configured offerings.
    
- **Four Strategies for Agility:**
    
    1. Treat offerings as tailored solutions and price on value.
        
    2. Collaborate deeply with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.
        
    3. Maintain flexible organizational structures that thrive on change.
        
    4. Empower and incentivize employees to innovate and adapt.

### Creating a Virtual Company

- **Virtual Organization:** Uses IT to link people, assets, and ideas across organizational boundaries.
    
- **Structure:** Dynamic workgroups and alliances via Internet/Intranet/Extranet connections.
    
- **Strategic Rationale:** Rapidly assemble capabilities for new market opportunities without heavy capital or infrastructure investment.

### Building a Knowledge-Creating Company

- **Knowledge Types:**
    
    - **Explicit:** Documented data and procedures.
        
    - **Tacit:** Employee know-how and insights.
        
- **Knowledge Management Systems (KMS):** Platforms to capture, organize, share, and leverage enterprise knowledge for continuous innovation.

#### **Case Study: Siemens AG’s Global KMS (“ShareNet”)**

- **Objective:** Break down silos; share expertise among 461,000 employees worldwide.
    
- **Features:** Hybrid of chat room, database, and search engine; employees post “best practices,” presentations, forecasts.
    
- **Results:**
    
    - $7.8 million investment yielded $122 million in sales within two years.
        
    - Enabled winning a $3 million Telecom Malaysia contract by connecting local sales to Denmark experts.
        
    - Secured a $460,000 Swiss hospital network deal despite higher bid through rapid, expert support via ShareNet.

### **Conclusion**

Strategic information systems are transformative—they redefine how organizations compete, operate, and innovate. By applying Porter’s models to pinpoint high-leverage areas, and by embracing customer focus, reengineering, agility, virtual structures, and knowledge management, firms can harness IT not merely for efficiency, but as a central pillar of competitive strategy.
