# **Enterprise Business Systems (continued)**

Below is a fully detailed, section-by-section summary of **Enterprise Business Systems (continued)**, covering every topic and sub-point. It’s organized into four major areas—CRM, SCM, EAI, and ECS—with clear headings and nested bullets so you can absorb each aspect easily.

---

## A. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

### 1. Business Focus & Objectives

- **Dual Objectives:**
    
    1. Give the organization—and every customer-facing employee—a single, complete view of each customer at every touchpoint and across all channels.
        
    2. Give customers a single, complete view of the company and its extended channels (partners, resellers, service networks).
        

### 2. Why CRM?

- **Cross-Functional Integration:**
    
    - Automates and links sales, marketing, and customer-service processes that interact with customers.
        
    - Builds an IT framework of web-enabled software plus a shared database to support end-to-end customer workflows and collaboration with partners.
        
- **Key Vendors:** Siebel Systems, Oracle, PeopleSoft, SAP AG, Epiphany.
    

### 3. Core Application Components

1. **Contact & Account Management**
    
    - Captures every past and planned contact (calls, e-mails, web visits, in-person) in a common customer database.
        
    - Data flows in real-time via Internet/Intranet links to sales, marketing, and service teams.
        
2. **Sales Automation**
    
    - Tools for prospect tracking, product configuration, quote generation.
        
    - Provides sales reps with a live, 360° customer view—alerts for cross-sell/up-sell and unresolved service issues.
        
3. **Marketing & Fulfillment**
    
    - Automates direct-marketing campaigns: lead qualification, mailing schedules, response tracking.
        
    - Analyzes campaign ROI and swiftly schedules follow-up contacts, capturing new prospect data.
        
4. **Customer Service & Support**
    
    - Call-center software routes inquiries by agent skill; help-desk tools surface solutions and next-steps.
        
    - Web self-service portals offer personalized FAQs with escalation to live support if needed.
        
5. **Retention & Loyalty Programs**
    
    - Focuses on existing-customer profitability:
        
        - It costs 6× more to acquire a new customer than to keep one.
            
        - A 5% lift in retention can boost profits by 85%.
            
    - Analytical modules (data-mining, customer data warehouses/marts) identify and reward top customers.
        

### 4. Benefits vs. Challenges

- **Potential Benefits:**
    
    - Lifelong customer relationships with higher revenue per account.
        
    - Real-time personalization; consistent experience across channels.
        
- **Common Pitfalls:**
    
    - Over 50% of CRM projects fail to meet expectations; 20% even harm customer ties.
        
    - Root cause: insufficient business-process redesign and change management—stakeholders aren’t engaged early, and new workflows aren’t adequately prepared for.

## B. Supply Chain Management (SCM)

### 1. The Business-Network Imperative

- **Legacy Pain:** Typical products (e.g., cereal) spend ~104 days routing through multiple intermediaries and warehouses.
    
- **E-Business Fusion:** Linking internal systems with those of suppliers, partners, and customers to eliminate waste and delays.
    

### 2. Defining SCM

- **Cross-Functional, Interenterprise System:**
    
    - Coordinates forecasting, inventory control, procurement, logistics, and feedback loops across all supply-chain partners.
        
- **Goal:** Deliver the right products, in the right quantity, to the right place, at the right time, and at acceptable cost.
    

### 3. Value-Chain Reengineering

- **Web-Enabling Processes:**
    
    - Intranets, extranets, and e-commerce portals drive tighter collaboration with suppliers, distributors, and retailers.
        
- **Objectives:**
    
    - Slash costs, boost efficiency, compress cycle times.
        
    - Improve interenterprise coordination to create seamless distribution and channel networks.
        

### 4. Benefits vs. Challenges

- **Expected Gains:**
    
    - Faster, more accurate order processing
        
    - Lower inventory carrying costs
        
    - Quicker time-to-market
        
    - Reduced transaction/materials expenses
        
    - Stronger strategic partnerships and agility
        
- **Implementation Hurdles:**
    
    - Complex solution selection amid rapid technology shifts
        
    - Growing partner ecosystems increase integration complexity
        
    - Key failure drivers—poor demand planning, inaccurate internal data, weak cross-departmental/supplier collaboration, immature SCM tools.

## C. Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)

- **Purpose:** Seamlessly connect disparate cross-functional systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, SCM) so they operate as a unified whole.
    
- **How It Works:**
    
    - **Middleware Services:** Data conversion, application messaging, interface adapters.
        
    - **Business-Rule Driven:** Data exchanges orchestrated according to process models defined by the organization.
        
- **Business Value:**
    
    - End-to-end visibility and coordination—e.g., call-center agents gain instant access to order, product, and customer history.
        
    - Accelerated order-to-cash cycles and improved responsiveness to customer events (as seen in Dell’s integrated environment).

## D. Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS)

### 1. Why ECS?

- Complex business decisions often require rapid ad-hoc data gathering, analysis, and input from geographically dispersed teams.
    

### 2. Core Goals

- **Communicate:** Share information seamlessly.
    
- **Coordinate:** Align individual tasks and resource usage.
    
- **Collaborate:** Jointly develop solutions and project deliverables.
    

### 3. Tool Categories

1. **Electronic Communication:** E-mail, instant messaging, presence awareness.
    
2. **Electronic Conferencing:** Audio, video, and web conferencing platforms.
    
3. **Collaborative Work Management:** Shared workspaces, document repositories, version control, workflow engines.

**Takeaway:**  
This continuation underscores how **CRM**, **SCM**, **EAI**, and **ECS** form a cohesive suite of cross-functional, interenterprise systems that drive customer focus, operational excellence, integrated processes, and effective team collaboration—each demanding careful planning, strong governance, and change-management to realize their full strategic potential.
