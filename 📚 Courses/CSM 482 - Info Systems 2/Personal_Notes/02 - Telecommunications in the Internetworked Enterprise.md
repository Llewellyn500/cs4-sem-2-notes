# **Telecommunications in the Internetworked Enterprise**

## **The Telecommunications Revolution**

### Definition & Components

- **Telecommunications:** Exchange of information (voice, data, text, images, audio, video) electronically over distance.
    
- **Revolution Drivers:**
    
    - **Technology:** Rapid advances (analog → digital, copper → fiber, emergence of wireless/satellite).
        
    - **Industry Structure:** Deregulation and new ownership/marketing models expanding service offerings. 

### The Merging of Computers & Communications

- **Information Superhighway:**
    
    - High-speed, public digital networks delivering information, education, entertainment.
        
    - Internet as the largest implementation—eliminates time/place barriers.
        
    - U.S. proposal for a national network linking universities, research centers, libraries, hospitals, and homes. 

### Trends in Telecommunications

1. **Industry Trends:**
    
    - Shift from state/regulated monopolies (e.g., AT&T pre-1984) to fiercely competitive markets offering local/global calls, satellite channels, cellular, cable TV, Internet access.
        
    - Telephone companies moving into information services (news, stock quotes, TV).
        
2. **Technology Trends:**
    
    - **Open Systems & Connectivity:** Adoption of TCP/IP, web browsers, middleware, firewalls—supporting Internet/intranet/extranet applications.
        
    - **Digital Transmission:** Higher speeds, capacity, lower cost/error, convergence of voice/data/video on same circuits.
        
    - **Media Evolution:** From copper/microwave to fiber-optics (laser pulses) and wireless (cellular, PCS, satellite).
        
3. **Application Trends:**
    
    - Explosion of e-business, e-commerce, enterprise collaboration—enabled by greater vendor/service choices, open standards, and Internet growth.

## **Using Telecommunications for Competitive Advantage**

- **Barrier Removal:** Geography/time barriers lifted—faster production, decision-making, product innovation, market entry, and customer relationships.
    
- **Key Applications:**
    
    - **Messaging & Coordination:** E-mail, voicemail, fax, digital info services.
        
    - **Real-Time Collaboration:** Teleconferencing, dataconferencing, videoconferencing, groupware.
        
    - **Transaction Automation:** Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).

## **Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)**

- **Definition:** Structured, computer-to-computer exchange of business documents (invoices, purchase orders) via telecommunications networks.
    
- **Benefits:**
    
    - Eliminates paper handling/input errors—saves time and money.
        
    - Locks in customers/partners by simplifying ordering vs. competitors.
        
    - Differs from e-mail by transmitting standardized fields (date, amount, sender, recipient).

## **The Business Value of Telecommunications Networks**

- **Value Drivers:**
    
    - **Cost Reduction:** Lower telecom and transaction costs.
        
    - **Lead-Time Compression:** Faster response throughout the supply chain.
        
    - **E-Commerce Enablement:** Platforms for online sales and support.
        
    - **Collaboration:** Enhanced workgroup coordination and resource sharing.
        
    - **Customer/Supplier Lock-In:** Through continuous connectivity.
        
    - **Innovation:** Faster development of new products/services.
        
- **Overcoming Barriers:** Networks help surmount geographic, time, cost, and structural obstacles to business success.

## **Groupware**

- **Purpose:** Software and services that support collaborative activities of fluid, user-defined workgroups across locations.
    
- **Functions:**
    
    - Information sharing (documents, best practices).
        
    - Electronic meetings, scheduling, chat rooms, discussion forums.
        
    - Version control and time-stamped message archives.
        
    - Shared work notes and progress tracking.
        
- **Outcome:** Sustained, asynchronous collaboration and knowledge retention within and across teams.

## **Networked Enterprises & the Internet**

### Enterprise Networking

- **Information Architecture:** Combination of hardware, software, telecom links, and data files arranged to distribute computing power to desktops and interconnect the entire enterprise.
    
- **Internetworking:** Linking separate LANs via a high-capacity backbone and external networks (Internet) while retaining individual identities. 
    

### The Client/Server Model

- **Concept:** Splits processing between client (desktop GUI, data input, analysis) and server (data storage, back-end processing, device management).
    
- **Ideal Experience:** User sees a seamless application despite distributed components.
    
- **Challenges:**
    
    - Complexity in writing distributed applications.
        
    - Server overload under heavy user demand.
        
    - Coordination and administration of many powerful microcomputers. 

### The Internet Revolution

- **Growth:** Fastest-growing global network of networks; millions of systems in 200+ countries.
    
- **Decentralization:** No central hub—any server routes messages by unique address codes.
    
- **Governance:** Standards set by advisory groups (Internet Society, W3C) to ensure interoperability and free flow of information.

### Popular & Business Uses

- **Evolution of Applications:** From simple information exchange to strategic platforms for:
    
    - Partner collaboration, customer/vendor support, e-commerce.
        
    - Marketing, sales, CRM, and cross-functional processes in engineering, manufacturing, HR, accounting.
        
- **Six Business Values of E-Business/E-Commerce:**
    
    1. New revenue via online sales
        
    2. Reduced transaction costs
        
    3. Customer acquisition through Web marketing
        
    4. Customer loyalty via improved Web support
        
    5. New Web-based markets/distribution channels
        
    6. New information-based Web products 

### The Role of Intranets

- **Definition:** Internal networks using Internet technologies (browsers, TCP/IP, HTML) for info sharing, communication, and process support—protected by firewalls/passwords.
    
- **Services:**
    
    - **Communication & Collaboration:** E-mail, voicemail, chat rooms, audio/video conferencing.
        
    - **Web Publishing:** Multimedia documents, newsletters, technical drawings—easy navigation via browsers/search engines.
        
    - **Business Operations:** Intranet-hosted order processing, inventory control, sales management, integrated with legacy systems.
        
- **Value:** Portal that unifies communication, publishing, operations, and management—extendable to partners via extranets. 

### The Role of Extranets

- **Definition:** Secure, Internet-based links connecting a company’s intranet with customers’, suppliers’, or partners’ intranets via VPNs or encrypted Internet connections.
    
- **Value:**
    
    - Simplifies partner access to internal resources.
        
    - Enables interactive, Web-enabled services for product development, marketing, distribution.
        
    - Strengthens strategic relationships and collaboration.
