## Key Points
- Euler is the father of graph theory
- in "Isomorphic" The structure must be the same.
- complete graph, each pair of vertices is joined by an edge. ==(Kn)==.  n - vertices

## Questions
- **Does your network topology affect the efficiency of your network?**
	**Answer:**
	Yes, the **network topology** significantly affects the **efficiency** of a network. In graph theory and computer science, the topology determines how nodes (vertices) in the network are connected (edges) and how data flows through the network. The choice of topology impacts factors like performance, reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
	###### **How Network Topology Affects Efficiency**
	1. **Data Transmission Efficiency**:
	    - **Direct paths** between nodes reduce the number of hops required for communication, minimizing delays.
	    - In dense topologies (e.g., **complete graphs**), every node is directly connected to every other node, which ensures optimal data transfer but increases cost.
	    - Sparse topologies (e.g., **trees**) may introduce longer delays due to indirect paths.
	2. **Scalability**:
	    - Some topologies, like **star** or **hierarchical**, scale well because adding new nodes doesn't require extensive changes to existing connections.
	    - Others, like **mesh** or **complete graphs**, become expensive or complex as the network grows due to the increase in edges.
	3. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**:
	    - In **redundant** topologies (e.g., **mesh**), alternate paths exist, so a failure in one link doesn't disrupt the network, enhancing reliability.
	    - In simpler topologies (e.g., **bus** or **ring**), a single failure can disrupt the entire network, reducing efficiency.
	4. **Traffic Handling**:
	    - Networks with high traffic require topologies that distribute loads efficiently, like **tree**, **mesh**, or **hybrid** topologies.
	    - Poorly chosen topologies can lead to congestion or bottlenecks, especially in **ring** or **bus** networks where resources are shared.
	5. **Cost vs. Efficiency Trade-Off**:
	    - High-efficiency topologies, like **fully connected** networks or **mesh**, are expensive to implement and maintain due to the large number of connections.
	    - Lower-cost topologies, like **star** or **bus**, may be less efficient in terms of speed and fault tolerance.
	    
	###### **Examples of Topologies and Their Effects**
	1. **Bus Topology**:
	    - **Efficiency**: Low for large networks due to shared communication medium; performance decreases as more nodes are added.
	    - **Cost**: Inexpensive but prone to bottlenecks and single points of failure.
	2. **Ring Topology**:
	    - **Efficiency**: Good for small, low-traffic networks, but a failure in one connection can disrupt the entire network.
	    - **Scalability**: Poor due to added delays as nodes increase.
	3. **Star Topology**:
	    - **Efficiency**: High for centralized communication but depends on the central hub. A hub failure disrupts the network.
	    - **Scalability**: Easy to add nodes without affecting others.
	4. **Mesh Topology**:
	    - **Efficiency**: Excellent due to multiple paths, providing fault tolerance and high throughput.
	    - **Cost**: Expensive to implement, especially in larger networks.
	5. **Tree/Hierarchical Topology**:
	    - **Efficiency**: Balances scalability and cost but can suffer from bottlenecks at higher levels of the hierarchy.
	    - **Scalability**: Good for structured growth.
		
	###### **Graph Theory Insights**
	In graph terms:
	- **Dense graphs** (e.g., complete graphs) have high connectivity and shorter paths between nodes but are resource-intensive.
	- **Sparse graphs** are cheaper and simpler but may lead to inefficiencies in data transfer due to longer paths.
	- **Redundant edges** in a graph increase **fault tolerance** and reliability but add cost.


- Can a planner graph be a complete graph?
Yes, a **planar graph** can be a **complete graph**, but only under specific conditions.
