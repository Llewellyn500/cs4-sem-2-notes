## Detailed Notes

### Vector spaces of a graph 

- A set is a collection of objects (called the elements of a set) and there is no specific number of a set
~~Fig 1~~
- Note that there is no specific nature of elements in a set except it belongs to the same set
let's take a set F. With 5 objects A,B,C,X,Y
s = {a,b,c,x,y}
==There is no specific order to the set till the questions says so==

A subset which is $S^1$ of a set S is a collection of some elements in the set S
~~Fig 2~~
### Complex graph operations 

#### Union

Given a graph G1 and G2 such that V(G1 U G2) = V(G1) U V(G2) and E(G1 U G2) = E(G1) U E(G2)

~~Fig 3~~

G($V_G$, $E_G$) And H($V_H$ $E_H$) Is a set of vertices in the same family

G U H = ($V_G$ U $V_H$, $E_G$ U $E_H$)

~~Fig 4~~

#### Difference of graph

Given 2 graphs G(V(G), E(G)) and H(V_H, E_H)
The difference grpah both contain the union of vertices of 2 graphs G and H and the edges in the difference is the difference of edges which is the difference of edges which is $E_G - E_G$ 

Rules
- The graph difference of any graph and its self of any graph is an empty graph
- the edges of the graph difference G - H are the complement of the edges of the graphs G and H
- the graph difference G - H of 2 graphs have the same vertices as graph union G U H
