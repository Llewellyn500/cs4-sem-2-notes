## **What is Computer Network?**

- A system of computers, print devices, network devices, and software, linked by communication media.
- It's simply two or more computers that are linked together for the purpose of sharing information, resources, or both.
- A **node** can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network

### **Types of Connections**

**Data Communications** are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. 

**Data** refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data.

**Telecommunication** means communication at a distance.

### **Components of a Data Communication System**

![[Picture2 1.png]]

The effectiveness of a data communication system depends on;
- Delivery
- Accuracy
- Timeliness
- Jitter

### **Data Flow (Transmission modes)**

## **Distributed Processing**

Task is divided among multiple computers instead of a single powerful computer handling all processing.

### **Advantages**

- Security
- Distributed Databases
- Faster problem solving
- Security through redundancy
- Collaborative processing


### **Benefits of  A Network**

- Information Sharing
- Hardware Sharing
- Software Sharing
- Collaborative environment

### **Risk of Network Computing**

The security is challenged by
- Equipment Malfunctions
- System failures
- computer hackers
- Virus attacks

## **Criteria for assessing a computer network effectiveness and efficiency**

- **Performance** (Measured using Transit Time, Response Time) - Depends on No of users, Type of transmission medium, Hardware, Software
- **Reliability** (measured by accuracy of delivery, network reliability, frequency of failure, recovery time of network after failure, network readiness in event of catastrophe)
- **Security** 


## **Network Categories**

Networks are usually classified using;
- Protocol
- Architecture
- Topology

### **Protocol**

It's simply an agreed-on set of rules and procedures for transmitting data between two or more devices

#### Features determined by the protocol are:
- How the sending device indicates it has finished sending the message
- How the receiving device indicates it has received the message
- The type of error checking to be used.

- Network Protocols: Ethernet, IBM's Token Ring
- Communications Protocol: TCP/IP


### **Architecture**

Refers to the way a network is designed and built
- Peer-to-peer architecture
- Client/Server architecture


### **Topology**

Refers to the way computers and peripherals are configured to form a network
- **Bus topology** - nodes are linked by a single line of cable
- **Star topology** -nodes are linked to a central computer called a host
- **Ring topology** - each node is connected to two other nodes, with the entire network forming a circle
- **Hybrid topology** - combine network layout types to meet their needs
