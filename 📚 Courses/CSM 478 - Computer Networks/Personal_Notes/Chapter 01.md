## **What is Computer Network?**

- A system of computers, print devices, network devices, and software, linked by communication media.
- It's simply two or more computers that are linked together for the purpose of sharing information, resources, or both.
- A **node** can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network

### **Types of Connections**

**Data Communications** are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. 

**Data** refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data.

**Telecommunication** means communication at a distance.

### **Components of a Data Communication System**

![[Picture2 1.png]]

### **Network Performance**

The effectiveness of a data communication system depends on;
- Delivery
- Accuracy
- Timeliness
- Jitter

### **Data Flow (Transmission modes)**

## **Distributed Processing**

Task is divided among multiple computers instead of a single powerful computer handling all processing.

### **Advantages**

- Security
- Distributed Databases
- Faster problem solving
- Security through redundancy
- Collaborative processing


### **Benefits of  A Network**

- Information Sharing
- Hardware Sharing
- Software Sharing
- Collaborative environment

### **Risk of Network Computing**

The security is challenged by
- Equipment Malfunctions
- System failures
- computer hackers
- Virus attacks

## **Criteria for assessing a computer network effectiveness and efficiency**

- **Performance** (Measured using Transit Time, Response Time) - Depends on No of users, Type of transmission medium, Hardware, Software
- **Reliability** (measured by accuracy of delivery, network reliability, frequency of failure, recovery time of network after failure, network readiness in event of catastrophe)
- **Security** 


## **Network Categories**

Networks are usually classified using;
- Protocol
- Architecture
- Topology

### **Protocol**

It's simply an agreed-on set of rules and procedures for transmitting data between two or more devices

#### Features determined by the protocol are:
- How the sending device indicates it has finished sending the message
- How the receiving device indicates it has received the message
- The type of error checking to be used.

- Network Protocols: Ethernet, IBM's Token Ring
- Communications Protocol: TCP/IP


### **Architecture**

Refers to the way a network is designed and built
- Peer-to-peer architecture
- Client/Server architecture


### **Topology**

Refers to the way computers and peripherals are configured to form a network
- **Bus topology** - nodes are linked by a single line of cable
- **Star topology** -nodes are linked to a central computer called a host
- **Ring topology** - each node is connected to two other nodes, with the entire network forming a circle
- **Hybrid topology** - combine network layout types to meet their needs

#### **Bus topology**

![[Picture1 3.png]]

- **Physical Structure:** Single coaxial cable with BNC terminators (50Î©) 
- Half Duplex
- **Collision Domain:** One shared collision domain for entire network 
- **Access Control:** CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) 
- **Advantages:** 
	- Simple to implement 
	- Cost-effective for small networks 
	- No central point of failure 
- **Disadvantages:** 
	- Security: All nodes see all traffic (promiscuous mode) 
	- Scalability: Performance degrades with more devices 
	- Reliability: Cable break affects entire network 
	- Collision Rate: Increases exponentially with network size

#### **Star topology**

![[Picture2 2.png]]

- **Central Device Options:** 
	- **Hub:** Repeater at Physical Layer (L1) - extends collision domain 
	- **Switch:** Operates at Data Link Layer (L2) - creates separate collision domains 
- **Switch Advantages:** 
	- **Microsegmentation:** Each port = separate collision domain 
	- **Full-duplex:** Simultaneous send/receive capability 
	- **Buffering:** Store-and-forward eliminates collisions 
- **Variations:** 
	- **Extended Star:** Multiple switches connected hierarchically 
	- **Distributed Star:** Switches connected in mesh pattern

#### **Mesh Topology**

![[Picture4.png]]

- **Full Mesh**: Every node connects to all others 
	- **Connections:** n(n-1)/2 links required 
	- **Redundancy:** Multiple paths between any two nodes 
	- **Cost:** Expensive due to cabling requirements 
- **Partial Mesh:** Strategic connections based on traffic patterns 
- **Applications:** Internet backbone, WAN connections, data centers

#### **Hybrid Topology**

![[Picture5.png]]

- **Star-Bus:** Ethernet switches connected via backbone bus 
- **Star-Ring:** Token Ring MAUs connected in star configuration 
- **Hierarchical:** Three-tier architecture (Core-Distribution-Access)

## **Transmission Modes** 

**Unicast (1:1)** 
- **Examples:** HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, Telnet 
- **Addressing:** Specific MAC/IP address 
- **Bandwidth:** Dedicated per session 

**Multicast (1:Many)** 
- **IP Range:** 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Class D) 
- **Examples:** Video streaming, software updates, routing protocols 
- **Protocols:** IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) 
- **Efficiency:** Single stream serves multiple recipients 

**Broadcast (1:All)** 
- **Layer 2:** MAC broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) 
- **Layer 3:** IP directed broadcast (subnet broadcast address) 
- **Examples:** ARP requests, DHCP discovery, NetBIOS name resolution 
- **Limitation:** Causes network congestion in large networks 
 
## **Collision Domains** 
- Hub: All ports share one collision domain 
- Switch: Each port creates separate collision domain 
- Bridge: Separates collision domains (legacy) 
- Router: Separates both collision and broadcast domains
