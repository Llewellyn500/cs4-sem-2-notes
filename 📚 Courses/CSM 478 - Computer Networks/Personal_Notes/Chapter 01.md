## **What is Computer Network?**

- A system of computers, print devices, network devices, and software, linked by communication media.
- It's simply two or more computers that are linked together for the purpose of sharing information, resources, or both.
- A **node** can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network

### **Types of Connections**

**Data Communications** are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. 

**Data** refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data.

**Telecommunication** means communication at a distance.

### **Components of a Data Communication System**

The effectiveness of a data communication system depends on;
- Delivery
- Accuracy
- Timeliness
- Jitter

### **Data Flow (Transmission modes)**

## **Distributed Processing**

Task is divided among multiple computers instead of a single powerful computer handling all processing.

### **Advantages**

- Security
- Distributed Databases
- Faster problem solving
- Security through redundancy
- Collaborative processing


### **Benefits of  A Network**

- Information Sharing
- Hardware Sharing
- Software Sharing
- Collaborative environment

### **Risk of Network Computing**

The security is challenged by
- Equipment Malfunctions
- System failures
- computer hackers
- Virus attacks

## **Criteria for assessing a computer network effectiveness and efficiency**

- **Performance** (Measured using Transit Time, Response Time) - Depends on No of users, Type of transmission medium, Hardware, Software
- **Reliability** (measured by accuracy of delivery, network reliability, frequency of failure, recovery time of network after failure, network readiness in event of catastrophe)
- **Security**
