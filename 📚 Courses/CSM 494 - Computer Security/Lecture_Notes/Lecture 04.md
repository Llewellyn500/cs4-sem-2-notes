## Detailed Notes

#### **Consolidation**

- Its synonymous with concentration in which a number of input channels convey sequential packets of data interspersed with empty packets to where no information is carried.
- It acts to remove redundant packets

#### **(FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing**

- The use of FDM is to share the circuit capacity of a single transmission line
- Separated into sections with each used for one channel of communication

#### **(TDM) Time Division Multiplexing**

- The time available transmission is subdivided into separate time slots with each slot for one channel of communication.
- Provides high density transmission

#### **(CDM) Code Division Multiplexing**

- Its an encrypted method originally developed for military in order to overcome interference or jamming.
- The technique involves multiplying the data signal to be coded with a high bit rate; pseudo â€“ random code

#### **Broadband Transmission**

- It enables the share of circuit capacity of a single transmission line.
- One frequency can take many different channels
- The modem in this mode (broadband modems) from a complementary pair

#### **Baseband Signaling**
