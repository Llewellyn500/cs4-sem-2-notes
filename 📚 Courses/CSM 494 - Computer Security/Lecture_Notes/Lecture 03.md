## Key Points
- impedance -> resistance in AC circuit 

## Detailed Notes
- There are 2 ways of data communication
	- wired (cable) -> 
		- twisted pair cables -> they are 2 cables that have been twisted together with opposite polarity and 180 degrees out of phase
			- Unshielded-> twisted cables with a jacket covering as an insulator
			- shielded -> shields are added to enhance the noise cancellation. 
		- coaxial cable -> 2 conductors. Inner one is held inside an insulator with the other woven around it providing a shield with a jacket covering it.
		- optical fiber -> thin glass carrying info at frequency in the visible light spectrum.
