## Key Points
- 

## Detailed Notes
#### Asynchronous and synchronous systems
- Asynchronous-> A separate timing channel is not used. 
#### Data packet
- Always begins with a logic '0' (starting bit) to signal the receiver that a transmission is starting.
- packet length is short in Asynchronous systems.
#### Parity and checksum
- A parity bit is a single bit added to a binary data transmission used to indicate whether the 0s and 1s within that data transmission are even or odd numbers.
- they are used as a first line of defense against data errors.
- mark parity bit has a binary that's always 1.
- the value of the parity but depends on the initial parity data.

Errors may not only be detected but also corrected if additional cose is added to a packet sequence. 

#### Data compression 
- it's trying to take out the spaces between transmission. 
- Hoffman Coding -> A compression method used in data communicationbans particaly in fax transmission.
#### Data encryption 
- data is scrambled so when unauthorised access gets a hold of it. They can't understand what they got.


## Questions
- How do you know if you use odd parity or even parity.
