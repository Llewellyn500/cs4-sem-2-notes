## **Ethics of Hacking and Cracking**

-  **Computer Cracking** - It's a term used for illegally hacking into a computer system without the permission of the system's owner.
- **Computer Hacker** - A computer expert with malicious intent

### **Hacker Communities (Categories of hackers)**

- White Hat (Good hackers)
- Black Hat (Bad hackers)
- Gray Hat (Both ways)

### **Hacker Profiling**

1. **Practitioner familiarity with techniques**:
    - To understand hackers, security professionals (practitioners) must deeply know the methods hackers use.
    - This is necessary to predict or counter their moves (like understanding your opponent in a game).

2. **Same techniques for ethical and malicious hackers**:
    - Ethical hackers (who test systems legally) and malicious hackers (who attack systems illegally) often use **the same tools and methods**.
    - The difference lies in **intent and permission**, not the techniques themselves.

3. **Hacker profiles are multifaceted**:
    - Hackers cannot be easily categorized.
    - They vary in skills, motivations, behaviors, and targets, making profiling complex.

4. **Black Hat Briefings convention**:
    - This is a well-known **security conference** where the latest hacking and security research is shared.
    - It includes contributions from corporate professionals, government experts, and underground hackers, making it a valuable learning place for understanding current hacking methods and trends.

### **Hacker Motivations**

- Curiosity
- Love of puzzles
- Desire for recognition or fame
- Revenge
- Financial Gain
- Patriotism or politics

### **Ethical Hacking**

- Ethics are the shared rules for "right vs. wrong" behavior. They tell both people and whole professions what is acceptable.
- If a field doesn’t write down and enforce clear ethical rules, outsiders have no guarantee its members will act responsibly, so they hesitate to trust or hire them.

### **Evolution of Hacking**

- **Late 1950s** (The modern concept of Hacking) - Students at MIT started using MIT mainframe to work on new languages
- **Early 1960s** (First password Hacks) - They were a response to the Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS)
- **1970s** (Phone Phreaks) - Accessed telephone networks to make free calls from payphones
	- Phreaking represents a subculture of hacking, primarily focused on manipulating and exploiting telephone networks.
- **1980s** (War Dialers + Cheap PC + Viruses, Worms, and Trojans)
	- War dialing is a technique used to automatically scan a list of telephone numbers to identify those that are connected to modems, computers, bulletin board systems, and fax machines.

## **Key Concepts**

- **Computer Cracking vs. Hacking**
    - Cracking = illegal intrusion without permission.
    - Hacker = computer expert; intent may be good or bad.

- **Hacker Communities (Figure 1-1)**
    - White Hat = “good” hackers, sanctioned to test and protect.    
    - Black Hat = “bad” hackers, motivated by profit, damage, notoriety.
    - Gray Hat = fall between, sometimes ethical, sometimes not.

- **Hacker Profiling**
    1. Practitioners must know attacker techniques inside-out.
    2. Ethical (legal) and malicious (illegal) hackers use the same tools—intent and authorization differ.
    3. Profiles are multifaceted: skills, motives, behaviors, targets vary widely.
    4. Black Hat Briefings = key annual conference showcasing both corporate/security research and underground methods.

- **Hacker Motivations**
    - Curiosity & puzzle-solving
    - Recognition or fame
    - Revenge
    - Financial gain
    - Patriotism or political activism

- **Evolution of Hacking**
    - 1950s–60s: MIT mainframe experimentation → first password hacks
    - 1970s: Phone-phreaking (free calls via telephone network tricks)
    - 1980s: War-dialers + PCs + early viruses/worms/Trojans
    - 1990s–today: Internet expansion → sophisticated malware and major security conferences

- **Security Certifications**
    - Vendor-neutral: CompTIA Security+™, GIAC, ISC² SSCP/CAP/CISSP
    - Vendor-specific: Cisco CCNA, Microsoft MCSA/MCSE, EC-Council CEH

- **What Needs Protecting**
    - Personal data, corporate IP, bandwidth, compute resources, copyrighted material

- **Role of Ethics**
    - Shared code of conduct builds public trust
    - Distinguishing ethical hackers from crackers highlights the profession’s benefits: safer systems, reduced cybercrime, stronger risk management
