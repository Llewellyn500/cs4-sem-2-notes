## Detailed Notes
- software engineering is the systematic approach to the dev of software that takes into account the approach the requirement stage, development, testing and evolution stage.
- computer program is writing some lines of instructions to complete a task
#### process involved in dev of software
- requirement gathering -> functional requirements and non functional requirements
	- you must interact with the stakeholders by way of survey, interview etc.
- development
- testing
- evolution / maintenance

#### Reasons why we engineer our software
- To ensure software projects don't over run
- Meet it's cost obligation (make sure it doesn't overdraw its budget)
- Meet it's quality dimension.
#### what determines the quality of a software
- it's noted in it's functional requirements and most importantly its non functional.
##### Functional Requirements 
- they are the functionality of the software
##### Non functional 
- The behavior of a software while in operation/execution 

##### Why do software engineering projects fail
- improper planning 
- wrong project definition
- inadequate funds
- lack of support
- lack of communication 
- lack of understanding
- lack of resources.
###### Improper planning.
- Draw your project action plan.
	- agree in project topic
	- review related topics
	- design interface for website
	- prototype Web interface
	- design database schema
###### Wrong project definition. 
- define exactly what you want to do from the onset
#### Functional requirements 
2 types;
- **Functional user requirements** -> an abstract representation/view of the system from the user perspective.
- **Functional system requirements** -> detail set of activities that a user undertakes in order to achieve a specific functional user requirements.
