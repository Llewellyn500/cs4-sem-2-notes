#### Software process activities
- requirements definition 
- development
	- design
	- coding
- testing
	- verification testing
	- validation testing
- evolution 
#### software process methods
- Agile method
- plan driven Method
#### software process planning
- Water fall

- Spiral model

We use the annotation `<<extend>>` when a substance has been executed to be correct. (check audio clip) -> used when a sub task can occur only under certain circumstances 

Feasibility study -> it has to be very detailed and shouldn't take much time.

Requirements discovery ->
- identify the stakeholders of the project (identify who you need to talk to, ro get info for the project.)

## Homework Assignments
- show relationship between the ff on a use case diagram.
	- request card
	- verify card
	- request pin
	- authenticate user pin
